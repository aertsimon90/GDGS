# GDGS - Generic Deep Generative System

## About
**GDGS (Generic Deep Generative System)** is an evolving artificial intelligence system designed to improve and adapt over time. Unlike conventional systems, GDGS learns from user interactions, adjusting its behavior to enhance its intelligence and efficiency. Over time, it becomes more adept at processing and responding to user inputs.

## Features

- **Self-Learning**: GDGS improves itself by interacting with users and learning from each conversation, becoming progressively smarter.
- **Neural Growth and Optimization**: The system dynamically adjusts its neural network. Neurons are added or removed based on performance and requirements.
- **Data-Driven Learning**: GDGS evolves through continuous learning, adjusting its responses to better match user expectations.
- **Customizable Training Parameters**: GDGS allows customization of training parameters such as training speed, number of neurons, and other performance-related factors.
- **Python-Based**: Built using Python, GDGS is flexible, easily customizable, and simple to integrate into various Python-based projects.
- **Integration with GitHub**: The source code is hosted on GitHub, which ensures easy access, collaboration, and updates.

## Installation

To get started with GDGS, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine by using the following command:

     `git clone https://github.com/aertsimon90/gdgs.git`

2. **Set Up the System**
   - Download the `gdgs.py` file from this repository and place it in your project directory.
   - Customize and adjust the code as needed to fit your specific use case.

3. **Run the System**
   - Simply execute the `gdgs.py` script to begin interacting with the AI.

## Usage

After setting up GDGS, you can begin interacting with it. Here’s a general workflow to get started:

1. **Create an Instance of GDGS**:
   - Initialize the system by creating an instance of GDGS.

2. **Interact with GDGS**:
   - Use the provided methods to interact with the AI, like sending messages and receiving responses. The AI will adapt and respond based on previous interactions.

3. **Training GDGS**:
   - If you'd like to train GDGS with new input data, you can add training data or new conversations for it to process. This helps improve its responses.

## Roadmap

GDGS is a continuously evolving system, with many exciting improvements planned:

- **Multi-Language Support**: While GDGS currently supports a single language per brain, future versions will allow multi-language support.
- **Enhanced Conversational Abilities**: The AI’s conversational skills will be further improved to allow longer and more meaningful dialogues.
- **Optimization**: Ongoing efforts will ensure GDGS operates more efficiently, reducing resource consumption while maintaining or improving its performance.

## Contributing

GDGS is open-source, and contributions are encouraged. Here’s how you can contribute:

- **Fork the repository** and create your branch for any new features or bug fixes.
- **Commit your changes** and push them to your forked repository.
- **Create a pull request** to merge your changes back into the main repository.
